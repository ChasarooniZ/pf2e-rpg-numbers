# 11.8.2 - Pointing and Customizations

- Rotate Towards Improvements
    
    - Rotation Offsets in token settings now work, so you can have any token turn towards their opponent before the take them out regardless of where they start
    - ![Rotating_example_1](https://github.com/ChasarooniZ/pf2e-rpg-numbers/assets/79132112/b1097d1e-0684-4c12-8d58-f24a203f5e22)

        - There is also options to enable some basic scaling options, they are pretty rudimentary, but as I think of ideas I will add more

- **Token Damage Shake**
    
    - Added new option that causes tokens to shake when they take damage (from a chat card)

    - Added new option to have token rotate when you make an attack (uses the attack roll type to determine)
    - Token rotates back after a second or so
    - Will probably add more optional settings
    - Have written stuff for token properties to set offset to the animation (so your token's "face" is looking at the target), but Sequencer seems to have a bug related to offset for rotate atm, so am waiting for that to be fixed for this to work
    
- **Check Color Themes**
    
    - Added start of compatability of themes so you can have color options, will expand as requested
    - Will also be expanding settings when I go back to change a bunch of how I handled settings
