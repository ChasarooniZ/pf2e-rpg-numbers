    -   Token rotates back after a second or so
    -   Will probably add more optional settings
    -   Have written stuff for token properties to set offset to the animation (so your token's "face" is looking at the target), but Sequencer seems to have a bug related to offset for rotate atm, so am waiting for that to be fixed for this to work
-   **Check Color Themes**
    -   Added start of compatability of themes so you can have color options, will expand as requested
    -   Will also be expanding settings when I go back to change a bunch of how I handled settings
